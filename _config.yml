  Mosti: 
  
  > I am fully committed to open-source software and actively contribute to multiple projects. I have a genuine passion for research and immerse myself in extensive reading. Exploring the interconnected web of knowledge through Wikipedia's hyperlinks and engaging with YouTube recommendations has proven to be time well spent, as it has broadened my understanding across various domains.
  During my leisure hours, I find great pleasure in building things and indulging in physical activities such as football (soccer), squash, or swimming, depending on the season or the mood.
