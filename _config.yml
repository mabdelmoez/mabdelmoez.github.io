about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  An engineer, expert, and leader, providing over a decade of engineering and leadership expertise in Switzerland.
  I lead people, teams, and organizations to develop, design, implement, and improve their cybersecurity posture and capabilities, from awareness to resilience, covering culture, design, code, infrastructure, and product. 
  I worked in different company sizes, with core businesses in Banking and Finance, File Sharing, and E-Commerce. 
  I have contributed to authoring, developing and implementing technical industry standards and guidelines (mostly in Banking & Finance).
  My latest academic achievement is an M.Sc. in Software and Systems Security from the University of Oxford (Distinction), and currently doing my EMBA at INSEAD (GEMBA '24).
  I am open-source all the way, and I contribute to a few projects already. I enjoy research, and I like to read a lot. I often get lost in Wikipedia’s hyperlinks and Youtube recommendations. However, that time didn’t go in vain, as I’ve gained a lot of knowledge in different fields. 
  In my free time, I enjoy building things, playing football (soccer)/squash/swimming depending on the season/mood. 
  You can call me with whatever matches this regex expression: ''^Mo(?:$|st|jo){1,}[fiav]{0,3}$''. If you are not interested to figure them all out, go for Mosti.
