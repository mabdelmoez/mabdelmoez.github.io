about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  An engineer who is curious by default, providing over a decade in software and systems engineering; and specializes in security engineering | practices. 
  I worked in different companies with core businesses in file sharing, finance, banking and e-commerce. 
  My latest academic achievement is an M.Sc. in Software and Systems Security from the University of Oxford (Distinction). 
  I am open-source all the way, and I contribute to a few projects already. I enjoy research, and I like to read a lot (not novels tho, I prefer to watch them). I often get lost in Wikipedia’s hyperlinks and Youtube recommendations. However, that time didn’t go in vain, as I’ve gained a lot of knowledge in different fields. 
  In my free time, I enjoy building things, playing football (soccer)/squash/swimming depending on the season/mood. 
  You can call me with whatever matches this regex expression: ''^Mo(?:$|st|jo){1,}[fiav]{0,3}$''. If you are not interested to figure them all out, go for, go for Mosti.
