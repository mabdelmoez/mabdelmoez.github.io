    I was the architectural and technical security lead of Avaloq's implementation of PSD2--authoring security concepts and guidelines. 
    Led engineers to design and implement various security mechanisms in the APIs and their infrastructure.
    Working with and consulting at various banks and third parties in Switzerland (and outside)--the APIs are now deployed at many banks (along with their security concepts and hardening guidelines).
